# HOSim

**HOSim** is a numerical wave simulation tool based on the High-Order Spectral (HOS) method. It allows for efficient simulation of nonlinear wave fields with customizable sea state parameters.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/HOSim.git
cd HOSim
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*The `requirements.txt` file is generated by `pipreqs` and includes all necessary packages.*

### Running a Simulation

To run a simulation:

```bash
python -m HOSim input/example
```

This will execute the simulation using the configuration specified in `input/example.json`.

### Example Input File

An example configuration (`input/example.json`) might look like:

```jsonc
{
  "simulation": {
    "Hs": [3.5, 2.5],          // [m] Significant wave height
    "Tp": [12.0, 10.0],        // [s] Peak period
    "gamma": [3.3, 3.3],       // [-] Spectrum peakedness
    "depth": [50, 40],         // [m] Water depth
    "length": 3000,            // [m] Spatial domain length
    "gravity": 9.81,           // [m/s²] Gravitational acceleration
    "modes": 512,              // Number of simulation modes
    "mHOS": 4,                 // Order of nonlinearity
    "time": 200,               // [s] Total simulation time
    "step_size": 0.025,        // [s] Time step for RK4
    "output_interval": 20,     // Output every N steps
    "Ta": 50                   // [s] Dommermuth initialization time
  }
}
```
